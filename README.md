    Supranim's Event Emitter - Subscribe & listen for various events within your application
</p>

## ‚ú® Key features
- [x] Framework Agnostic
- [x] Available in ‚ö°Ô∏è [Supranim Framework](https://github.com/supranim/supranim)
- [ ] Persistent Memory w/ Supranim Storage driver
- [x] Dependency-free
- [x] Open Source | `MIT` License

## Install
```bash
nimble install emitter
```

## Examples
Listeners can receive data as `varargs[Arg]` objects, containing a public `value` field of `Any` object. [Check std/typeinfo](https://nim-lang.org/docs/typeinfo.html#Any)

### Framework agnostic usage

```nim

# somewhere in your main application
Event.listen("account.email.changed") do(args: varargs[Arg]):
    echo "Email address has been changed."
    # do the do, send confirmation mails, etc...

# somewhere in your proc-based ``POST`` or ``UPDATE`` controller
let newEmailAddress = "new.address@example.com"
Event.emit("account.email.changed", newArg(newEmailAddress))
```

### Emitter from Supranim
For apps based on [Supranim Application Template](https://github.com/supranim/app).
Note that all listeners should be stored inside `events/listeners` directory.

In Supranim is highly recommended to create a `.nim` file for each branch of your application logic.
For example, `account.nim` should hold all listeners related to accounts (email updates, password reset requests and so on).

For loading listeners into your application is recommended to use `include`, instead of `import`. Listener files can be included
in the main state of your application (this is usually the main `.nim` file of your project.)

_TODO. Create new listeners using `Sup`, the Command Line Interface of your Supranim application_

```nim
# src/events/listeners/account.nim

Event.listen("account.email.update") do(args: varargs[Arg]):
    echo "The email address has been changed."

Event.listen("account.password.reset.request") do(args: varargs[Arg]):
    echo "Request for password reset."

Event.listen("account.password.update") do(args: varargs[Arg]):
    echo "Password has been changed."
```

### üëë Discover Nim language
<strong>What's Nim?</strong> Nim is a statically typed compiled systems programming language. It combines successful concepts from mature languages like Python, Ada and Modula. [Find out more about Nim language](https://nim-lang.org/)

<strong>Why Nim?</strong> Performance, fast compilation and C-like freedom. We want to keep code clean, readable, concise, and close to our intention. Also a very good language to learn in 2022.
